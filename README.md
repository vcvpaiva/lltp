TPTP linear logic version

This is Valeria's fork of the work with Carlos Olarte, Giselle Reis and Elaine Pimentel that appeared in the Linearity/TLLA 2018 Workshop
https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/TLLALinearity18/ as "Benchmarking Linear Logic Translations".


The paper is:

Carlos Olarte, Valeria de Paiva, Elaine Pimentel, Giselle Reis. The ILLTP Library for Intuitionistic Linear Logic. 
arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.06850, 01 February 2019. 

Recently I started working with Andrea Loparic on reproving the Kleene "little theorems" by hand, 
to show where linearity constraints need to be used.
